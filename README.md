# RNASeq Analysis of Human Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Treated with Lespedeza Bicolor Root Extract
This repository contains the data and code for an RNASeq analysis performed on human triple negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and BT549 after treatment with Lespedeza bicolor root extract. The analysis aims to explore changes in gene expression related to cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion in response to the treatment.

# Experimental Design
	Cell Lines: Human triple negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and BT549
	Treatment: Lespedeza bicolor root extract
	Concentration: 5 Âµg/mL
	Duration: 48 hours

# Data
The high-throughput sequencing technology was used to generate RNASeq data from treated and control samples of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. The raw sequencing data is available in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1090846

# Analysis Pipeline
The RNASeq data analysis pipeline includes:

	Quality control of raw sequencing data
	Alignment of reads to the reference genome
	Quantification of gene expression levels
	Differential gene expression analysis

# Results
The analysis identified differentially expressed genes associated with the treatment of Lespedeza bicolor root extract in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells. Further exploration of these genes may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for triple negative breast cancer.

# Usage
To reproduce the analysis, follow the instructions in analysis/README.md. (to be updated soon)
